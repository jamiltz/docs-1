You can send native push notifications alongside realtime messages, and subscribe devices to receive them.

Ably's core realtime service dispatches messages published to a channel to connections subscribed to it. Those messages may carry an *extra push notification* payload. Devices subscribed to that channel for push will then receive the notification natively, be it through APNs for iOS, GCM/FCM for Android devices, or Web Notifications for browsers.

h2(#getting-started). Getting started

To get push notifications up and running for your app:

1. "Set up your native services credentials in Ably's dashboard.":#set-up-dashboard
2. "Use our library to activate Ably's push service for a device.":#activate-device
3. "Subscribe the device to Ably channels for push.":#subscribe-device
4. "Send messages with an extra push payload.":#send-push-payload

h3(#set-up-dashboard). Set up credentials in your dashboard

Not ready yet. For now, tell us and we'll set up everything for you behind the curtain.

h3(#activate-device). Activate push for a device

blang[default].
  This section refers to your clients' code. Select a client platform above to see instructions.

  You can also see "how to set up your server to register on the devices' behalf":#activating-from-server.

blang[objc,swift,fcm,gcm].
  h4. Hook Ably up with the native APIs

  First, you need to hook up the native APIs for subscribing for push notification with Ably's library, so that Ably can handle things for you.

blang[fcm,gcm].
  If you haven't yet, you should set up <span lang="gcm">"GCM":https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/client</span><span lang="fcm">"FCM":https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client</span> in your app.

  After doing so, you'll have a class inheriting from <span lang="gcm">@IntentService@, which your implementation of @InstanceIDListenerService@ invokes on its @onTokenRefresh@ method</span><span lang="fcm">@FirebaseInstanceIdService@</span>. We need that class to inherit from <span lang="gcm">@AblyRegistrationIntentService@</span><span lang="fcm">@AblyFirebaseInstanceIdService@</span> and just call its parent's <span lang="gcm">@onHandleIntent@</span><span lang="fcm">@onTokenRefresh@</span> method. This method needs you to pass <span lang="gcm">a sender ID (@getString(R.string.gcm_defaultSenderId)@) and</span> an @AblyRest@ instance, configured with the authentication setup and other options you need. Your class should end up looking more or less like this:

  ```[gcm]
  public class MyRegistrationIntentService extends AblyRegistrationIntentService {
      @Override
      protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {
          this.onHandleIntent(intent, getString(R.string.gcm_defaultSenderId), getAblyRest());
      }

      private static AblyRest getAblyRest() {
          ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions();
          // Set up options; API key or auth URL, etc.
          try {
              return new AblyRest(options);
          } catch (AblyException e) {
              throw new RuntimeException(e);
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  ```[fcm]
  public class MyFirebaseInstanceIDService extends AblyFirebaseInstanceIdService {
      @Override
      public void onTokenRefresh() {
          super.onTokenRefresh(getAblyRest());
      }

      private static AblyRest getAblyRest() {
          ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions();
          // Set up options; API key or auth URL, etc.
          try {
              return new AblyRest(options);
          } catch (AblyException e) {
              throw new RuntimeException(e);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

blang[objc,swift].
  If you haven't yet, you should set up "APNs":https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html in your app.

  You should now have a couple of methods: <span lang="swift">"@application(_:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:)@":https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622958-application</span><span lang="objc">"@application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:@":https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622958-application?language=objc</span> and <span lang="swift">"@application(_:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:)@":https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622962-application</span><span lang="objc">"@application:​did​Fail​To​Register​For​Remote​Notifications​With​Error:​@":https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622962-application?language=objc</span>. @ARTPush@ has two corresponding methods that you should call from yours, passing to them also an @ARTRest@ instance, configured with the authentication setup and other options you need.

  ```[objc]
  // In your UIApplicationDelegate class:
  - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
      [ARTPush didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken rest:[self getAblyRest]];
  }

  - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error;
      [ARTPush didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error rest:[self getAblyRest]];
  }

  - (ARTRest *)getAblyRest {
      ARTClientOptions *options = [[ARTClientOptions alloc] init];
      // Set up options; API key or auth URL, etc.
      return [[ARTRest alloc] initWithOptions: options];
  }
  ```
  ```[swift]
  // In your UIApplicationDelegate class:
  optional func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
      ARTPush.didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken(deviceToken, rest: self.getAblyRest())
  }

  optional func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
      ARTPush.didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError(error, rest: self.getAblyRest())
  }

  func getAblyRest() -> ARTRest {
      var options = ARTClientOptions()
      // Set up options; API key or auth URL, etc.
      return ARTRest(options: options)
  }
  ```

blang[objc,swift,fcm,gcm].
  (You probably want to share @getAblyRest@ or a similar method with the code that connects to Ably's realtime service, if you do use it.)

  h4. Call @activate@

  Once you've done this, then, whenever you want to start receiving push notifications from Ably (e. g. from <span lang="fcm,gcm">your main activity</span><span lang="objc,swift">your @UIApplicationDelegate@</span>), you call <span lang="fcm,gcm">@AblyRest.push.activate@</span><span lang="objc,swift">@ARTRest.push.activate@</span>:

  ```[gcm,fcm]
  AblyRest ably = getAblyRest();
  ably.push.activate(context);
  ```
  ```[objc]
  ARTRest *ably = [self getAblyRest];
  [ably.push activate];
  ```
  ```[swift]
  let ably = self.getAblyRest()
  ably.push.activate()
  ```

  If your client doesn't have "the required capabilities":#required-capabilities, you probably want to register devices from your server, which will have the right capabilities. <span lang="fcm,gcm">Do this instead...</span><span lang="objc,swift">See "how to activate devices from your server":#activating-from-server.</span>

blang[fcm,gcm].
  ```[gcm,fcm]
  ably.push.activate(context, true);
  ```

  ... and see "how to activate devices from your server":#activating-from-server.

blang[objc,swift,fcm,gcm].
  @activate@ will *register the device* for push: it tells Ably about the current device, and how to reach it to deliver push notifications. Its effects outlive the current process: once called, the device will stay registered even after the application is closed, until @deactivate@ is called.
  @activate@ is idempotent: calling it again when device is already activated has the sole effect of calling its callback.

  h4. Register for @activate@ 's callback

  You should be notified when push has been activated for the device, so that you can then subscribe to channels. For this, Ably will <span lang="fcm,gcm">send a broadcast through the application's @LocalBroadcastManager@. Listen for a broadcast with action @io.ably.broadcast.PUSH_ACTIVATE@,</span><span lang="objc,swift">call your application's </span><span lang="objc">@(void)didActivateAblyPush:(nullable ARTErrorInfo *)error@</span><span lang="objc">@didActivateAblyPush(error: ARTErrorInfo?)@</span><span lang="objc,swift"> method, so you should handle it</span> like this:

  ```[gcm,fcm]
  LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(context.getApplicationContext()).registerReceiver(new BroadcastReceiver() {
      @Override
      public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
          ErrorInfo error = IntentUtils.getErrorInfo(intent);
          if (error != null) {
              // Handle error.
              return;
          }

          // Subscribe to channels, etc.
      }
  }, new IntentFilter("io.ably.broadcast.PUSH_ACTIVATE"));

  ably.push.activate(context);
  ```
  ```[objc]
  // Add a delegate method to your UIApplicationDelegate class:
  - (void)didActivateAblyPush:(nullable ARTErrorInfo *)error {
      if (error) {
          // Handle error.
          return;
      }

      // Subscribe to channels, etc.
  }

  // Call activate, which will call the delegate method when done:
  [ably.push activate];
  ```
  ```[swift]
  // Add a delegate method to your UIApplicationDelegate class:
  func didActivateAblyPush(error: ARTErrorInfo?) {
      if let error = error {
          // Handle error.
          return
      }

      // Subscribe to channels, etc.
  }

  // Call activate, which will call the delegate method when done:
  ably.push.activate()
  ```

h3(#subscribe-device). Subscribe for push notifications

Before you subscribe to a channel for push, make sure its namespace is configured as push-enabled.

TODO: Still not supported in the dashboard. For now, we'll enable them for you.

There are two ways a device can be subscribed to a channel: directly "by its device ID":#subscribing-device-id, or indirectly "by its associated client ID":#subscribing-client-id.

h4(#subscribing-device-id). Subscribing by device ID

A **device ID** uniquely identifies a device within Ably's services.

blang[default].
  You'll need your client to pass it to your server if you want to subscribe on their behalf; select the appropriate client platform from above to see how to do this.

  Once you have a device's ID, you can subscribe it by using the "admin API":#admin-api.

blang[objc,swift,fcm,gcm].
  If your client "has the appropriate capabilities":#push-capabilities, you don't need to know your device ID. You can just do:

  ```[objc]
  [[rest.channels get:@"pushenabled:foo"].push subscribeDevice:^(ARTErrorInfo *_Nullable error) {
      // Check error.
  }];
  ```
  ```[swift]
  rest.channels.get("pushenabled:foo").subscribeDevice { error
      // Check error.
  }
  ```
  ```[gcm,fcm]
  rest.channels.get("pushenabled:foo").push.subscribeDevice(context);

  // or

  rest.channels.get("pushenabled:foo").push.subscribeDeviceAsync(context, new CompletionListener() {
      @Override
      public void onSuccess() {}

      @Override
      public void onError(ErrorInfo errorInfo) {
          // Handle error.
      }
  });
  ```

  If your client doesn't have the right permissions, you must communicate the device ID to your server so that it can subscribe on the device's behalf. You can find it at <span lang="objc,swift">@ARTRest.device.id@</span><span lang="fcm,gcm">@AblyRest.device().id@</span>. The server must then "use the admin API":#admin-api to subscribe.

h4(#subscribing-client-id). Subscribing by client ID

When a device is registered, it can be associated with a "client ID":/rest/authentication/#identified-clients. @AblyRest.push.activate@ takes the client ID from the @AblyRest@ or @AblyRealtime@ instance.

You can subscribe to a channel all devices associated with a client ID with a single operation: a subscription by client ID. New device registrations associated to that client ID will also be subscribed to the channel, and if a device registration is no longer associated with it, it will also stop being subscribed to the channel (unless it's also "subscribed directly by device ID":#subscribing-device-id).

To subscribe your @AblyRest@ or @AblyRealtime@ instance's client ID to a channel:

```[objc]
[[rest.channels get:@"pushenabled:foo"].push subscribeClient:^(ARTErrorInfo *_Nullable error) {
    // Check error.
}];
```
```[swift]
rest.channels.get("pushenabled:foo").subscribeClient { error
    // Check error.
}
```
```[gcm,fcm]
rest.channels.get("pushenabled:foo").push.subscribeClient();

// or

rest.channels.get("pushenabled:foo").push.subscribeClientAsync(new CompletionListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {}

    @Override
    public void onError(ErrorInfo errorInfo) {
        // Handle error.
    }
});
```

Alternatively, if you want to subscribe a different client ID, you can "use the admin API":#admin-api.

h3(#send-push-payload). Send push notifications

Push notifications are sent as special payloads alongside "a normal Ably message":#/realtime/types/#message. It should go as an object on key @push@ within the @extras@ dictionary, like this:

```[objc]
ARTMessage *message = [[ARTMessage allocWithName:@"example" data:@"realtime data"]];
message.extras = @{
    @"push": @{
        @"notification": @{
            @"title": @"Hello from Ably!",
            @"body": @"Example push notification from Ably."
        },
        @"data": @{
            @"foo": @"bar",
            @"baz": @"qux"
        }
    }
};
[[rest.channels get:@"pushenabled:foo"] publish:@[message] ^(ARTErrorInfo *_Nullable error) {
    // Check error.
}];
```
```[swift]
var message = ARTMesssage(name: "example", data: "realtime data")
message.extras = [
    "push": [
        "notification": [
            "title": "Hello from Ably!",
            "body": "Example push notification from Ably."
        ],
        "data": [
            "foo": "bar",
            "baz": "qux"
        ]
    ]
]
rest.channels.get("pushenabled:foo").publish([message]) { error
    // Check error.
}
```
```[gcm,fcm]
Message message = new Message("example", "realtime data");
message.extras = io.ably.lib.util.JsonUtils.object()
    .add("push", io.ably.lib.util.JsonUtils.object()
        .add("notification", io.ably.lib.util.JsonUtils.object()
            .add("title", "Hello from Ably!")
            .add("body", "Example push notification from Ably."))
        .add("data", io.ably.lib.util.JsonUtils.object()
            .add("foo", "bar")
            .add("baz", "qux")));

rest.channels.get("pushenabled:foo").publish(message, new CompletionListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {}

    @Override
    public void onError(ErrorInfo errorInfo) {
        // Handle error.
    }
});
```

A push payload has a generic structure. Depending on the transport (APNs, F/GCM, etc.), these are the transformations made:

<table>

<tr>
  <th>Field</th>
  <th>F/GCM</th>
  <th>APNs</th>
  <th>Web</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>@notification.title@</td>
  <td>@notification.title@</td> <!-- F/GCM -->
  <td>@aps.alert.title@</td> <!-- APNs -->
  <td>@notification.title@</td> <!-- Web -->
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>@notification.body@</td>
  <td>@notification.body@</td> <!-- F/GCM -->
  <td>@aps.alert.body@</td> <!-- APNs -->
  <td>@notification.body@</td> <!-- Web -->
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>@notification.icon@</td>
  <td>@notification.icon@</td> <!-- F/GCM -->
  <td>Discarded.</td> <!-- APNs -->
  <td>@notification.icon@</td> <!-- Web -->
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>@notification.sound@</td>
  <td>@notification.sound@</td> <!-- F/GCM -->
  <td>@aps.alert.sound@</td> <!-- APNs -->
  <td>@notification.sound@</td> <!-- Web -->
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>@notification.collapseKey@</td>
  <td>@collapse_key@</td> <!-- F/GCM -->
  <td>@aps.thread-id@</td> <!-- APNs -->
  <td>@notification.collapseKey@</td> <!-- Web -->
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>@data@</td>
  <td>@data@</td> <!-- F/GCM -->
  <td>Merged into root object.</td> <!-- APNs -->
  <td>@data@</td> <!-- Web -->
</tr>

</table>

Additionally, you can set transport-specific objects, which will get merged into the root object resulting from generic mapping explained above only when pushing to the selected transport. This way, you can:

* Override the generic value for that field.
* Add specific fields that are not supported in the generic structure.

To do this, alongside @notification@ and @data@, add an object whose field is one of:

* @fcm@, for FCM and GCM.
* @apns@, for APNs.
* @web@, for Web Notifications.

Here's an example of push payload that overrides the default title for iOS and sets the Android-specific @color@ field:

```
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Hello from Ably!",
    "body": "Example push notification from Ably."
  },
  "data": {
    "foo": "bar",
    "baz": "qux"
  },
  "apns": {
    "aps": {
      "alert": {
        "title": "Hello to iOS from Ably!"
      }
    }
  },
  "fcm": {
    "notification": {
      "color": "#d3d3d3"
    }
  }
}
```

h2(#push-capabilities). Push capabilities

These are the "capabilities":/general/authentication/#capabilities-explained necessary to perform push operations:

* @push-subscribe@: Register new devices, deregister them, and subscribe and unsubscribe them to channels for push notifications.
* @push-admin@: Register, update and deregister any device registration, and subscribe and unsubscribe to channels for push notifications. Publish push notification using the @POST /push/publish@ endpoint (@AblyRest.push.publish@ method).

Typically, client devices subscribing for push will either have @push-subscribe@ privileges or "delegate operations to a server":#activating-from-server with @push-admin@ privileges.

h2(#activating-from-server). Activating devices from your server

The default for @AblyRest.push.activate@ is to register the device with Ably directly from the device, but you can instead delegate that to your server.

blang[objc,swift].
  For this, your @UIApplicationDelegate@ must implement these methods:

  ```[objc]
  - (void)ablyPushCustomRegister:(nullable ARTErrorInfo *)error deviceDetails:(nullable ARTDeviceDetails *)deviceDetails callback:(void (^ _Nonnull)(ARTUpdateToken * _Nonnull, NSError * _Nullable))callback {
      if (error) {
          // Handle error.
          return;
      }

      [self registerThroughYourServer:deviceDetails callback:callback];
  }
  
  - (void)ablyPushCustomDeregister:(nullable ARTErrorInfo *)error deviceId:(nullable ARTDeviceId *)deviceId callback:(void (^ _Nullable)(NSError * _Nullable))callback {
      if (error) {
          // Handle error.
          return;
      }

      [self deregisterThroughYourServer:deviceId callback:callback];
  }
  ```

blang[fcm,gcm].
  For this, you need to communicate back and forth with the Ably library via the application's @LocalBroadcastManager@.

  First, make sure you pass @true@ as @activate@ 's @useCustomRegisterer@ (and @deactivate@ 's @useCustomDeregisterer@) parameter.

  ```[fcm,gcm]
  ably.push.activate(context, true);
  ably.push.deactivate(context, true);
  ```

  The Ably library will then broadcast a @io.ably.broadcast.PUSH_REGISTER_DEVICE@ action when it needs you to register from your server, and @io.ably.broadcast.PUSH_DEREGISTER_DEVICE@ when it needs you to deregister. You must configure a listener to those actions in your application's @AndroidManifest.xml@, and from it answer back with a @PUSH_UPDATE_TOKEN@ or @PUSH_DEVICE_DEREGISTERED@, like this:

  ```[xml]
  <receiver android:name=".MyAblyBroadcastReceiver" >
    <intent-filter>
       <action android:name="io.ably.broadcast.PUSH_REGISTER_DEVICE" />
       <action android:name="io.ably.broadcast.PUSH_DEREGISTER_DEVICE" />
    </intent-filter>
  </receiver>
  ```

  ```[fcm,gcm]
  public class MyAblyBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
      @Override
      public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
          AblyRest ably = getAblyRest();
          String action = intent.getAction();

          if (action.equals("io.ably.broadcast.PUSH_REGISTER_DEVICE")) {
              DeviceDetails device = ably.device(context);
              boolean isNew = intent.getBooleanExtra("isNew", false);

              Intent response = new Intent();

              try {
                  String updateToken = registerThroughYourServer(device, isNew);
                  response.putExtra("updateToken", updateToken);
              } catch(AblyException e) {
                  IntentUtils.addErrorInfo(intent, e.errorInfo);
              }

              LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(context.getApplicationContext()).sendBroadcast(intent);
          } else if (action.equals("io.ably.broadcast.PUSH_REGISTER_DEVICE")) {
              DeviceDetails device = ably.device(context);

              Intent response = new Intent();

              try {
                  deregisterThroughYourServer(device.id);
              } catch(AblyException e) {
                  IntentUtils.addErrorInfo(intent, e.errorInfo);
              }

              LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(context.getApplicationContext()).sendBroadcast(intent);
          }
      }
  }
  ```
