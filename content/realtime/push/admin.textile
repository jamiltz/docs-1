h3(#platform-install). Platform installation

p(tip). Whilst platform installation is platform specific, all subsequent Ably API calls are not. Make sure you select the language above you wish to see all code examples in.

*Note: To use push notifications you need to use v1.1+ of our client libraries. As push notifications are still in beta, please "get in touch":https://www.ably.io/contact if you'd like to download one of the unreleased v1.1 client libraries. Currently push notifications are supported in our iOS, Android, Ruby, Node and Javascript libraries*
